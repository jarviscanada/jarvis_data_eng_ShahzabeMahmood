# Introduction

This repository contains the results of my SQL Learning Project, focused on developing practical SQL skills and a solid understanding of Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). The project includes a series of SQL queries designed to cover essential database concepts such as data retrieval, joins, subqueries, aggregation, and data manipulation (CRUD operations). Each query is aimed at solving specific use cases and improving efficiency in working with relational data. The repository showcases my approach to SQL problem-solving and demonstrates my ability to interact with complex datasets using SQL.

# SQL Quries

###### Table Setup (DDL)

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cd.members (
    memid INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY ,
    surname VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    firstname VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
    zipcode INTEGER NOT NULL,
    telephone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    recommendedby INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES cd.members(memid) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    joindate TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cd.bookings (
    bookid INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
    facid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES cd.facilities(facid),
    memid INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES cd.members(memid),
    starttime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    slots INTEGER NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cd.facilities (
    facid INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    membercost NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    guestcost NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    initaloutlay NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    monthlymaintenance NUMERIC NOT NULL
);
```




###### Question 1: Insert new facility into database

```sql
insert into cd.facilities

```

###### Question 2: Insert new facility with auto-generated id into database

```sql
insert into cd.facilities
(facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance)
values ((select max(facid) from cd.facilities)+1, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800)
```

###### Question 3: Update incorrect initial outlay value

```sql
update cd.facilities
set initialoutlay = 10000
where facid = 1; 
```

###### Question 4: Update value using computed value

```sql
update cd.facilities facs
set
membercost = (select membercost * 1.1 from cd.facilities where facid = 0),
guestcost = (select guestcost * 1.1 from cd.facilities where facid = 0)
where facs.facid = 1;  
```

###### Question 5: Delete all bookings

```sql
delete from cd.bookings
```

###### Question 6: Delete specific member id

select *
from cd.facilities

```

###### Question 13: List start times for tennis court bookings on 2012-09-21
