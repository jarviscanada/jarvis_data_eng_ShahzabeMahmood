# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/master/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/4guO98u)
    description: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring tool to collect and track hardware specs and resource usage data from multiple nodes. Utilized Bash for scripting, Docker for PostgreSQL containerization, and Git for version control. Implemented two key scripts, host_info.sh for capturing static hardware information and host_usage.sh for real-time monitoring of CPU and memory usage. Designed to support cluster performance management and resource optimization for future planning.
  - name: "Stock Quote Application"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/master/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/4guO98u)
    description: Engineered Developed a terminal-based Stock Quote App that simulates stock trading by integrating real-time and historical market data from the Alpha Vantage API. The app supports CRUD operations for stock quotes and user positions, using JDBC for database interaction with PostgreSQL, Maven for build automation, and Docker for containerization. The project follows the DAO and Repository design patterns, ensuring modularity and scalability by abstracting database access and enabling easy technology swaps. The app is tested with JUnit and Mockito for unit and integration tests, ensuring proper functionality and data integrity across database transactions. This solution is scalable, maintainable, and easily deployable.
  - name: "Core Java - Grep App"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/master/core_java"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/4guO98u)
    description: Developed a high-performance, Java-based file search application inspired by the Linux grep command, designed for efficient pattern matching using Java Streams, file I/O, and regular expressions. Refactored the initial design to optimize memory usage with Java Streams' lazy evaluation, allowing on-demand processing and reducing memory overhead, enhancing scalability for larger datasets. Containerized the application with Docker for streamlined, cross-environment deployment, available on Docker Hub. Validated functionality with Java Unit Testing to ensure reliability and performance, making the application robust, lightweight, and deployable in diverse environments..

    #URL is optional
    git_url: "https://github.com/ShahzabeM/GameKnight"
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed an application called GameKnight which is a game library web application that can store and manage a game library across different platforms. The application lets gamers filter their game libraries to find and remember games from their past and find the games they want to play in the future. The application is powered using Django and connects to a backend database which can be configured in the settings. MariaDB/MySQL was used in application testing, however other databases should work if connected to Django in settings.
  - name: "Autonomous Vehicle Cruise Control"
    git_url:
    description: Engineered advanced autonomous vehicle software using the ROS2/Autoware stack, integrating cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to enhance system intelligence and decision-making capabilities. Developed a high-performance AI model that leveraged LiDAR sensors and depth cameras for real-time object detection, distance estimation, and environmental awareness. Optimized project workflows through Git-based version control and employed a Kanban board to ensure seamless collaboration, version management, and timely project execution within the simulation environment..
