    description: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring tool to collect and track hardware specs and resource usage data from multiple nodes. Utilized Bash for scripting, Docker for PostgreSQL containerization, and Git for version control. Implemented two key scripts, host_info.sh for capturing static hardware information and host_usage.sh for real-time monitoring of CPU and memory usage. Designed to support cluster performance management and resource optimization for future planning.

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed an application called GameKnight which is a game library web application that can store and manage a game library across different platforms. The application lets gamers filter their game libraries to find and remember games from their past and find the games they want to play in the future. The application is powered using Django and connects to a backend database which can be configured in the settings. MariaDB/MySQL was used in application testing, however other databases should work if connected to Django in settings.
  - name: "Autonomous Vehicle Cruise Control"
