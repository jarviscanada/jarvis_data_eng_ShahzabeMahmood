# Shahzabe Mahmood . Jarvis Consulting

I'm a results-driven Software Engineer with a strong focus on data and full-stack development, holding a B.Eng in Software Engineering from Ontario Tech University. I specialize in building scalable, cloud-native applications and data pipelines using Python, Java, Spark, and SQL across AWS, Azure, and GCP platforms. At Jarvis Consulting, I've led the development of automated ETL pipelines, integrated React frontends with backend services, and deployed robust cloud infrastructure supporting analytics and internal tools. My work spans end-to-end systems?from ingesting and transforming large-scale datasets to delivering insights through clean APIs and Power BI dashboards. With hands-on experience in Agile environments, CI/CD, and containerized workflows, I bring both backend engineering depth and frontend fluency (React, HTML/CSS). I'm passionate about bridging engineering with business needs, solving complex problems, and continuously expanding my skill set.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood)


**Cluster Monitoring System** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring tool to collect and track hardware specs and resource usage data from multiple nodes. Utilized Bash for scripting, Docker for PostgreSQL containerization, and Git for version control. Implemented two key scripts, host_info.sh for capturing static hardware information and host_usage.sh for real-time monitoring of CPU and memory usage. Designed to support cluster performance management and resource optimization for future planning.

**Stock Quote Application** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/develop/core_java/JDBC)]: Engineered Developed a terminal-based Stock Quote App that simulates stock trading by integrating real-time and historical market data from the Alpha Vantage API. The app supports CRUD operations for stock quotes and user positions, using JDBC for database interaction with PostgreSQL, Maven for build automation, and Docker for containerization. The project follows the DAO and Repository design patterns, ensuring modularity and scalability by abstracting database access and enabling easy technology swaps. The app is tested with JUnit and Mockito for unit and integration tests, ensuring proper functionality and data integrity across database transactions. This solution is scalable, maintainable, and easily deployable.

**Core Java - Grep App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/develop/core_java/grep)]: Developed a high-performance, Java-based file search application inspired by the Linux grep command, designed for efficient pattern matching using Java Streams, file I/O, and regular expressions. Refactored the initial design to optimize memory usage with Java Streams' lazy evaluation, allowing on-demand processing and reducing memory overhead, enhancing scalability for larger datasets. Containerized the application with Docker for streamlined, cross-environment deployment, available on Docker Hub. Validated functionality with Java Unit Testing to ensure reliability and performance, making the application robust, lightweight, and deployable in diverse environments.

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/develop/python_data_analytics)]: Developed a data analytics pipeline to analyze transactional data for a UK-based online giftware retailer, leveraging Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to extract insights on sales trends, customer behavior, and marketing optimization. Conducted data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify revenue fluctuations, customer retention patterns, and seasonal sales trends. Implemented RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for customer segmentation, classifying users into groups such as "Loyal Customers" and "At Risk" to enhance targeted marketing strategies. Ensured data integrity, visualization accuracy, and code modularity, delivering a reproducible and scalable analysis documented in Jupyter Notebook and deployed via GitHub.

**Spark** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/develop/spark)]: Analyzed the World Development Indicators (WDI) and retail datasets using Zeppelin notebooks on Google Cloud Platform's Dataproc and Azure Databricks, respectively. Leveraged PySpark to efficiently process large-scale distributed data. For the WDI dataset, extracted key economic metrics such as GDP per country. For the retail dataset, analyzed critical sales insights, including total revenue, sales growth trends, and new monthly users, to inform business growth strategies.

**Hadoop** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahzabeMahmood/tree/develop/hadoop)]: Designed and implemented a scalable big data processing solution on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Dataproc. Integrated Apache Zeppelin for interactive analytics and leveraged the Hive interpreter for SQL-based querying on distributed datasets. This solution supports enterprise-level real-time analytics and efficient data processing.


## Highlighted Projects
**GameKnight - Video Game Library** [[GitHub](https://github.com/ShahzabeM/GameKnight)]: Developed an application called GameKnight which is a game library web application that can store and manage a game library across different platforms. The application lets gamers filter their game libraries to find and remember games from their past and find the games they want to play in the future. The application is powered using Django and connects to a backend database which can be configured in the settings. MariaDB/MySQL was used in application testing, however other databases should work if connected to Django in settings.

**Autonomous Vehicle Cruise Control**: Engineered advanced autonomous vehicle software using the ROS2/Autoware stack, integrating cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to enhance system intelligence and decision-making capabilities. Developed a high-performance AI model that leveraged LiDAR sensors and depth cameras for real-time object detection, distance estimation, and environmental awareness. Optimized project workflows through Git-based version control and employed a Kanban board to ensure seamless collaboration, version management, and timely project execution within the simulation environment..
